# mealplanner

A web app to create random weekly food plan. Will let you:

1. Don't be hassled with figuring out what to eat each week. This is a source of
lengthy discussions with my wife.
2. Don't waste food by planning what ingredients to buy exactly.
3. Don't bother with writing down or figuring our a food list.

# How to run

The code is for a small django app to be run. Make sure you have Python 3 installed
and follow the steps below, after cloning the repo

```
cd mealplanner

pip install -r requirements.txt

python manage.py runserver
```

The app will start up on a local webserver on port 8000.
